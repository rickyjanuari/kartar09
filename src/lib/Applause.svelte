        'I’ve worked with many engineers over the past ten years, and Markus is a beast. He’s self-directed, thoughtful, and fast. He has excellent written and verbal communication skills and is candid and direct when his opinion is asked. I reached out to him for some unorthodox app development based on his GitHub profile and what I feateal would take weeks and thousands of dollars was complete in days and far beyond my expectations. My only hesitation in writing this review for him is that I want all his time for myself and have no doubt that he will be in high demand, given his skill set and personal qualities. Grab this guy quick because he’s about to be in limited supply.',
